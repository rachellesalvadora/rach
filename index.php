			<h1>CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science | edX </h1>
			<h2>'Demanding, but definitely doable. Social, but educational. A focused topic, but broadly applicable skills. CS50 is the quintessential Harvard course'</h2>

			<p class="grid__item two-thirds">CS50 Was an Introduction to Computer Science MOOC offered through Harvard University through edX. The course was designed to teach studnets how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. <br/><br/>
				There were multiple ways to take the course,
				I chose to take the one with a verified certificate, Senior lecturer on Computer Science of Harvard University, <a href="http://cs.harvard.edu/malan">David Malan</a>'s and Huntington D. Lambert, Dean of Harvard Extension School signature.<br/>
				<br/> I came from not knowing any coding language, never touching a code editor in my life, to creating for loops, if statements, variables in C, PHP, JavaScript and even making web pages using SQL / CSS and HTML. <br/><br/>
				CS50 is being offered again late 2014 and 2015 as far as I know. It's a great stepping stone for anyone who wants to get serious with Computer Science.
